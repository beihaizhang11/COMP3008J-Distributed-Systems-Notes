# Election Algorithms
## Goal
Election algorithms choose a process from a group of processors to act as a **coordinator**. If the coordinator process crashes due to some reasons, then a **new** coordinator is elected on other processor. Election algorithm basically determines where a new copy of the coordinator should be **restarted** .
## Two Algorithms
* Ring Algorithms
* Bully Algorithms
## Measurement of performance
* total network bandwidth utilization
* turnaround time for the algorithm
