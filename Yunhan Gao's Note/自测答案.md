#### 1. Why are distributed systems vulnerable to security attacks? List and define the main types of attack.

- Promote the sharing of resources - open to external access
- Exposed interfaces to services offered by the  distributed system
- Insecure networks
- Hackers likely to have knowledge of the algorithms used to deploy services in distributed systems

1. **Eavesdropping** – obtaining copies of messages without authority.
2. **Masquerading** – sending or receiving messages using the identity of another principal without their authority.
3. **Message Tampering** – intercepting messages and altering their contents before passing them on to the intended recipient.
4. **Replaying** – storing intercepted messages and sending them at a later date.
5. **Denial of Service** – flooding a channel or other resource with messages in order to deny access to others.

#### 2. Two tech aid scalability

#### 3. Two algorithm to sync physical time

#### 4. What is a routing overlay? Describe how the Pastry peer-to-peer middleware implements routing.

A mechanism in application layer, plays a role of finding resources in the **middleware** system, ensure any node can access any resource by  routing each request through a sequence of nodes.1

1. Comparing destination address D with its **own GUID**, if =, send to itself.
2. If D **in Leafset**, send M to the element that has **closest GUID** to D in the leaf set.
3. If D **outside Leafset**, and **Routing table** is not empty, send M to a node with a **longer common prefix**.
4. If D **outside Leafset**, and **Routing table** is empty, send M to any node in L or R with a common prefix that the GUID that is numerically closer.

#### 5. What is an Election Algorithm and what it is used for? Briefly present the two election algorithms considered in this course.

Election Algorithm is a mechanism that choose the **leader** process to meet a special role of DS.

- **Ring Algorithm**: 

  Processes grouped in a logical ring, each process receive from left and send to right. It select the process that has biggest ID, and told every process use 2 loop of message.

- **Bully Algorithm:** 

  Three type of messages: Election Message: Sent to announce election. Answer (Alive) Message: Responds to the Election message. Coordinator (Victory) Message: Sent by winner of the election to announce victory.

#### 6. What is mutual exclusion? Describe 3 approach: *centralised*, *distributed*, and *token ring*.

A mechanism used to protect a shared resource within a Distributed System.

**Three techniques:**

1. **Centralized:** a single coordinator controls whether a process can enter a critical region.
2. **Distributed:** the group confers to determine whether or not it is safe for a process to enter a critical region.
3. **Token Ring:** processes are organized into a logical loop and use a token to determine when to enter a critical region.

#### 7. Diff between loosely-coupled/tightly-coupled

#### 8. Why DS no global clock

#### 9. Why middleware important

Middleware is the set of processes or objects in a group of computers that interact with each other to implement communication and resource-sharing support for Distributed Systems

#### 10. Diff between **Stateful** & **Stateless**, Adv and Disadv

**Stateful**: The File Server keeps a copy of a requested file in memory until the client has finished with it.

**Stateless**: The File Server treats each request for a file as self-contained.

|              | Stateful                                          | Stateless                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Advantage    | Increased performance by **fewer disk accesses**. | The effects of server failures and recovery are almost **unnoticeable**. |
| Disadvantage | A stateful server **loses all state** in a crash. | 1. Longer request messages<br />2. Slower request processing |



#### 11. What is Flat file system? **3** component of FFS

FFS is a file directory that can contain only files (no subdirectories).

**Three components:**

- Flat File Service 
- Directory Service 
- Client Module

#### 12. Diff between capabilty list and access list

#### 13. Diff netween Routing overlay and Ip routing (6)

|                            | IP Routing                                                   | Routing Overlays                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scalability**            | IPv4 is limited to **2^32** addressable nodes, IPv6- **2^128**， all  suffers from the same **hierarchy issue**. | The GUID name space is very large (**> 2^128**).<br />Uses a **flat structure** - all addresses can be used |
| **Load Balancing**         | Loads on routers are determined by **network topology** and associated **traffic patterns**. | Object locations can be **randomized**  and hence traffic patterns are **not determined** by the network topology. |
| **Network Dynamics**       | IP routing tables are updated asynchronously on a best-efforts basis with time constants of the order of **one hour**. | Routing tables can be updated  **synchronously** or **asynchronously** with fractions of **a second delays**. |
| **Fault Tolerance**        | Redundancy is designed into an IP network by its managers, ensuring tolerance of a single router or network connectivity failure. <br />**n-fold tolerance is expensive** | Routes and object **references can be replicated n-fold**, ensuring tolerance of n  failures of nodes or connections. |
| **Target Identification**  | Each IP address maps to exactly one target node              | Messages can be routed  to the **nearest replica** of a target node |
| **Security and Anonymity** | Addressing is only secure when **all nodes are trusted**.<br />**Anonymity** for the owners of addresses is **not achievable**. | Security can be achieved even in environments with limited trust.<br />A limited degree of **anonymity can be provided**. |

#### 14. What is **GMS**? **4** components of GMS

A **Group Membership Service (GMS)** is a service that provides  support for the (dynamic) management of both **group membership** and **multicast communication**.

**Four main objectives:** 

1. Interface for group membership change
2. Failure detector
3. Membership change notification
4. Group address expansion

#### 15. Diff between acitve replication/passive replication

#### 16. What is Replication system? 5 steps handel request



#### 17. What is Grid computing?

- Grid computing is a type of distributed computing where multiple computer systems, often geographically dispersed, are networked together to work collaboratively on complex tasks.
- It allows for the sharing, selection, and aggregation of resources (like processing power, storage, or data) from different organizations or locations, enabling the execution of large-scale computations that would be difficult for a single machine or data center to handle. 
- Resources supported by heterogeneous computer hardware, operating systems, programming languages and applications.

#### 18. Primary requirements of Grid computing

- Remote Access to Resources
- Processing where it is stored and managed
- Dynamic Service Creation
- Metadata
- Directory Services
- Management Software

#### 19. What is cryptography? 3 Main uses

Uses:

- Secrecy and Integrity
  Ensuring the safety and correctness of information of  transmitted over networks.
- Authentication
  Supporting communication between pairs of principals:
- Digital Signatures

#### 20. Diff between Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption algorithm

- Symmetric encryption uses a single key that needs to be shared among the people who need to receive the message while asymmetrical encryption uses a pair of public key and a private key to encrypt and decrypt messages when communicating.

- Symmetric encryption is an old technique while asymmetric encryption is relatively new. 

- Asymmetric encryption was introduced to complement the inherent problem of the need to share the key in symmetrical encryption model, eliminating the need to share the key by using a pair of public-private keys.

- Asymmetric encryption takes relatively more time than the symmetric encryption.

#### 21. Cache
Caching can significantly reduce client response times.
- Maintaining a local copy of resources reduces the need to access remote servers
